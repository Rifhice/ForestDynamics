# ForestDynamics
“Forest dynamics” is a project involving the implementation of an algorithm within an interface which simulate the evolution of the population of a forest. The algorithm uses a mathematical model, which focuses on an individual in a population, it was originally made by Bolker and Pacala. The simulation starts when the user enters the different parameters for a single tree, it displays the population of the forest in a toroid and the evolution of the population in a graph. From there, the user is able to decide if he wants to change the parameters, to put the simulation on pause or to save the data collected by the simulation. The project was made in the programming language Java.
